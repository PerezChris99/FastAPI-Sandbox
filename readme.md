**FastAPI: A Beginner's Guide**

This repository is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

**What is FastAPI?**

FastAPI is a web framework that leverages Python's type hints to provide:

*   **Automatic Interactive API Documentation:** Generate beautiful, interactive API documentation (like Swagger UI) directly from your code.
    
*   **Enhanced Editor Support:** Benefit from improved autocompletion and type checking in your development environment.
    
*   **High Performance:** FastAPI is incredibly fast, thanks to its use of ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and optimized performance.
    
*   **Easy to Learn:** The framework is designed to be intuitive and easy to pick up, even for beginners.
    

**Getting Started**
        
2.  **Setting up:**
    
    *  Run the setup.bat file

**Basic Example**

*   **FastAPI():** Creates an instance of the FastAPI class.
    
*   **@app.get("/"):** Defines a path operation for the root URL (/).
    
*   **async def root():** Defines an asynchronous function that handles the request.
    
*   **return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}:** Returns a JSON response.
    
*   **uvicorn.run(...):** Starts the development server.
    

**Run the Application**

1.  Save the code above as main.py.
    
2.  uvicorn main:app --reload --reload automatically restarts the server when you make changes to the code.
    

**Access the API**

*   Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
    
*   You should see the JSON response: {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}.
    

**Key Concepts**

*   **Path Operations:** Functions that handle requests for specific URLs (e.g., @app.get(), @app.post(), @app.put(), @app.delete()).
    
*   **Path Parameters:** Extract values from the URL (e.g., /items/{item\_id}).
    
*   **Query Parameters:** Extract values from the query string (e.g., /items?skip=0&limit=10).
    
*   **Request Body:** Handle data sent in the request body (e.g., JSON, form data).
    
*   **Response Models:** Define the structure of the data returned in the response.
    
*   **Dependency Injection:** Inject dependencies (e.g., database connections, external services) into your path operation functions.
    
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilize async and await keywords for efficient handling of concurrent requests.
    

**Explore Further**

*   **Documentation:** Refer to the official FastAPI documentation for in-depth information and advanced features.
    
*   **Examples:** Explore the official FastAPI examples repository for more complex use cases.
    
*   **Community:** Engage with the FastAPI community on platforms like Stack Overflow and Discord for support and discussions.
