# FastAPI Learning Playground

This repository serves as a learning resource and a sandbox for exploring the capabilities of **FastAPI**, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

**What is FastAPI?**

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It leverages key features such as:

* **Asynchronous programming:** Enables handling multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and scalability.
* **Type hints:** Enhances code readability, maintainability, and helps catch errors early on.
* **Automatic interactive documentation:** Generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI or Redoc) directly from your code.
* **Data validation and serialization:** Utilizes Pydantic for robust data validation and efficient data serialization.

These features make FastAPI a popular choice for developing efficient, reliable, and developer-friendly APIs for various applications, including:

* **Microservices:** Building small, independent services that work together.
* **RESTful APIs:** Creating APIs that adhere to REST architectural principles.
* **Backend for Web Applications:** Serving as the backend for web applications, mobile apps, and single-page applications (SPAs).
* **Machine Learning Model Serving:** Exposing machine learning models as APIs for real-time predictions.

**Project Structure:**

This repository will contain a collection of FastAPI projects, each exploring different aspects and features of the framework. 

**Getting Started:**

For each project within this repository:

1. **Clone the specific project directory:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>/<project_directory>

# Project Setup Guide

## Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
- Execute `setup.bat` (if available).
- Alternatively, create a virtual environment manually:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure (If Necessary)
- Adjust any project-specific configurations (e.g., database connections).

## Run the Application
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with:
- New FastAPI projects
- Improvements to existing projects
- Bug fixes

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational and experimental purposes. The code within may not be production-ready and may require further refinement and testing.
